Question 3.4:
Frequency resolution is equal to the sampling rate, Fs, divided by the fft size, .
In this assignment we considered the entire signal, N = 22050 samples, with a sampling rate of, Fs = 44100Hz.
That gives a frequency range of Fs/N = 44100Hz/22050 samples or 0.5Hz/sample

The frequency resolution of the FFT is:
Fs/N = 0.5Hz/sample

Question 3.5:
Zero padding a time-domain waveform does not improve the underlying frequency resolution so the frequency resolution of the zero-padded input signal would not change.
